Added [Collection] attribute for test isolation, comprehensive negative test cases (zero/negative epsilon, zero/negative sensitivity, unsupported mechanisms, missing budget context, invalid delta values), boundary condition tests (very large epsilon, PositiveInt clamping), and statistical validation tests (Laplace and Gaussian noise distribution verification with 500 samples and proper variance checking)
